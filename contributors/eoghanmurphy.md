# Eoghan Murphy Log Book

## Week 2

- Defined the communication between the simulation backend and the rendering frontend.
- Built the first simulated 3D room files for testing purposes.
  - This involved modelling simple rooms inside Blender and exporting their respective files to then be used by the renderer and simulation.
- Wrote the documentation for the public headers on our simulation library.
  - Set up `doxygen` (a documentation library) and a GitHub pages so our documented code can be read through without the source code.
